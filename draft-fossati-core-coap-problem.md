--- abstract

This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-readable
details of errors in a CoAP response to avoid the need to define new error
response formats for CoAP APIs.

# Introduction

CoAP {{!RFC7252}} response codes are sometimes not sufficient to convey enough
information about an error to be helpful.

This specification defines a simple and extensible CBOR {{!RFC7049}} format to
suit this purpose.  It is designed to be reused by CoAP APIs, which can
identify distinct "problem types" specific to their needs.

Thus, API clients can be informed of both the high-level error class (using the
response code) and the finer-grained details of the problem (using this
format).

The format presented is largely inspired by the Problem Details for HTTP APIs
defined in {{?RFC7807}}.

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# CoAP Problem Details Definition

A CoAP Problem Details is encoded as a CBOR map with the following members:

* "ns" (int) - A code-point that defines the namespace under which the "type"
  field needs to be interpreted.  This is a mandatory field.

* "type" (uint) - A code-point that identifies the problem type within the
  namespace.  This is a mandatory field.

* "title" (text) - A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It
  SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem.

* "response-code" (8-bit uint) - The CoAP response code ({{!RFC7252}}, Section
  5.9) generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.

* "detail" (text) - A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of
  the problem.

* "instance" (uri) - A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of
  the problem.  It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.

Consumers MUST use "ns" and "type" as primary identifiers for the problem type;
the "title" string is advisory and included only for consumers who are not
aware of the semantics of the "ns" and "type" values.

The "response-code" member, if present, is only advisory; it conveys the CoAP
response code used for the convenience of the consumer.  Generators MUST use
the same response code in the actual CoAP response, to assure that generic CoAP
software that does not understand this format still behaves correctly.
Consumers can use the response-code member to determine what the original
response code used by the generator was, in cases where it has been changed
(e.g., by an intermediary or cache), and when message payloads persist without
CoAP information.  Generic CoAP software will still use the CoAP response code.

The "detail" member, if present, ought to focus on helping the client correct
the problem, rather than giving debugging information.  Consumers SHOULD NOT
parse the "detail" member for information; extensions (see
{{sec-new-attributes}}) are more suitable and less error-prone ways to obtain
such information.

Note that "instance" accepts relative URIs; this means that it must be resolved
relative to the document's base URI, as per {{!RFC3986}}, Section 5.

## CDDL

The definition in CDDL format {{!RFC8610}} of a Problem Details for CoAP is
provided in {{fig-cddl}}.

~~~
coap-problem-details = {
  ns => int,
  type => uint,
  ? title => text,
  ? response-code => uint .size 1,
  ? detail => text,
  ? instance => uri,
  * $$coap-problem-details-extension,
}

ns = 0
type = 1
title = 2
response-code = 3
detail = 4
instance = 5

# Extensibility

The format presented can be extended at two separate points that allow the
definition of:

* New error type values (see {{sec-new-types}}); and
* New error attributes (see {{sec-new-attributes}}).

## Defining New Problem Types
{: #sec-new-types}

The mechanism for defining new problem types is designed to allow private use,
for example by organisations or projects, while at the same time supporting the
use of this error format in public protocols and APIs, as well as ease of
transition between the two -- for example if an API is first developed
internally to an organisation and then open-sourced.  Another critical design
objective is to enable delegating the administration of the code-points space
to entities (and experts) that are "closer" to the actual usage and intended
meaning of the code-points.  In fact, an explicit desiderata is to avoid having
experts looking over a very big and diverse semantic space.

To meet these goal, new problem types are always defined (and have a meaning)
within a namespace.  The namespace range is itself partitioned in three
separate sub-ranges: a completely private space, one devoted to private
organisations and projects, and a third one used for public APIs and protocols.
The rules for registering a new namespace are outlined in
{{iana-namespace-registry}}.

The registration procedures for new problem types are not defined in this
document.  At a minimum, though, new problem type definitions SHOULD document:

1. A parent namespace;
2. Their own code-point;
3. A title that appropriately describes the problem type (think short); and
4. The CoAP response-code for it to be used with.

A problem type definition may specify additional attributes on the
problem details map (see {{sec-new-attributes}}).

(Note: moving a set of error types from the private to the public space needs
only changing the namespace identifier while leaving all error types the
same.)

##Â Defining New Problem Attributes
{: #sec-new-attributes}

Problem type definitions MAY extend the problem details object with additional
attributes to convey additional, problem-specific information.

Clients consuming problem details MUST ignore any such extensions that they
don't recognize; this allows problem types to evolve and include additional
information in the future.

CoAP Problem Details can be extended via the coap-problem-details-extension
CDDL socket (see Section 3.9 of {{!RFC8610}}.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of {{?RFC7807}} apply in full.

# IANA Considerations

## Registration of a Content-Format identifier for application/coap-problem+cbor

This document requests that IANA registers the following Content-Format to the
"CoAP Content-Formats" sub-registry, within the "Constrained RESTful
Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry, from the Expert Review space
(0..255):

   | Media Type                    | Encoding | ID   | Reference |
   | application/coap-problem+cbor | ---      | TBD1 | RFCthis   |

## New Registries

This document requests that IANA create the following new registries:

* CoAP Problem Namespaces ({{iana-namespace-registry}});
* CoAP Problem Details ({{iana-details-registry}}).

### CoAP Problem Details Registry
{: #iana-details-registry}

The "CoAP Problem Details" registry keeps track of the allocation of the
integer values used as index values in the coap-problem-details CBOR map.

Future registrations for this registry are to be made based on {{!RFC8126}} as
described in {{tab-details}}.

   | Range            | Registration Procedures |
   | 0...N            | Standards Action        |
   | N+1...4294967295 | Specification Required  |
{: #tab-details title="CoAP Problem Details Registration Procedures"}

All negative values are reserved for Private Use.

Initial registrations for the "CoAP Problem Details" registry are provided in
{{tab-details-init}}.  Assignments consist of an integer index value, the item
name, and a reference to the defining specification.

   | Index | Index Name    | Specification |
   | 0     | ns            | RFCthis       |
   | 1     | type          | RFCthis       |
   | 2     | title         | RFCthis       |
   | 3     | response-code | RFCthis       |
   | 4     | detail        | RFCthis       |
   | 5     | instance      | RFCthis       |
{: #tab-details-init title="CoAP Problem Details Initial Registrations"}

### CoAP Problem Namespace Registry
{: #iana-namespace-registry}

The "CoAP Problem Namespace" registry keeps track of the problem namespace
values.

Future registrations for this registry are to be made based on {{!RFC8126}} as
described in {{tab-types}}.

   | Range            | Registration Procedures |
   | -L...-1          | First Come First Served |
   | 0...M            | Standards Action        |
   | M+1...4294967295 | Specification Required  |
{: #tab-types title="CoAP Problem Types Registration Procedures"}

All negative values less than L are reserved for Private Use.

The initial registration for the "CoAP Problem Namespace" registry is provided
in {{tab-types-init}}.  Assignments consist of an integer index value, the item
name, and a reference to the defining specification.

   | Value | Description | Specification |
   | 0     | The "global" namespace | RFCthis |
{: #tab-types-init title="CoAP Problem Namespace Initial Registrations"}
